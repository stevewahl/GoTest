Hi!  This was fun.  I like this approach to letting a candidate show
their ability to (1) follow the specs, and (2) write code as it is
normally done [rather that whiteboard some classroom coding task].

So that you know the commands supported by each of these go http 
servers, please read their .go source file header comments.

Thanks,

Steve Wahl
